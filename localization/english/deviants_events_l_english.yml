 deviants_event.0800.t: "My Deviant Body"
 deviants_event.0800.desc: "As I look at my bare body, I feel it even now, alone in my bedchamber. The throbbing urges, the untamed perversion. I'm tainted, cursed by my own flesh.\n\nAt the center of it all is my special place. Oozing with deviant impulses, tempting me with pleasure and excess. But it's wrong, I have decided to try and repent, and fix myself. Make myself chaste."
 deviants_event.0800.a: "I need to punish myself!" 
 deviants_event.0800.a.tt: "You will show no mercy to your perverted flesh."
 deviants_event.0800.b: "I need a public shaming!" 
 deviants_event.0800.b.tt: "If a crowd of commoners can't fix you, nothing will."
 deviants_event.0800.c: "Just some minor acts will do." 
 deviants_event.0800.c.tt: "A bit of prayer, some good acts. Maybe it's not that bad."

 deviants_event.0801.t: "That Place"
 deviants_event.0801.desc: "The place is swelling even now, like my twisted body has no limits on its shame. It's expecting that I indulge again, that I pleasure myself. So it even gets a bit wet from anticipation. Taunting me.\n\nBut I won't give in this time. I will punish my perverted nature even if it's the last thing I do. I just need to decide how. What could possibly teach my perverted body to behave?"
 deviants_event.0801.a: "Punish my deviant knob." 
 deviants_event.0801.a.tt: "This is all that thing's fault, the source of your deviant desires."
 deviants_event.0801.b: "Teach my horny flower a lesson." 
 deviants_event.0801.b.tt: "If only you could make your flesh learn that nothing good comes from perversion."

 deviants_event.0802.t: "My Devil's Teat"
 deviants_event.0802.desc: "I clamp my nails into my knob with anger but it's not enough, the damned thing assaults me with pleasure, trying to tempt me to give in. But I won't, and I have a special weapon. A metal clamp that I lock into the cancerous grows and squeeze it with my fingers. The hard surface bends a bit, locking into my flesh.\n\nAs the knob gives my senses a sharp cry of pain, I grin from joy. But the pain only lasts for a moment before the numb pleasure overtakes it. I lock my nails to the tip of the knob that is swelling out of the clamp.\n\nI keep trying but I can bring the pain back only for short moments, it keeps getting defeated by the pulsing and ever-expanding numb throb. That then makes me burn, filling me with pleasure.\n\nI feel defeated, I think of giving in. maybe this is not how to cure myself."
 deviants_event.0802.a: "Keep going. No mercy." 
 deviants_event.0802.a.tt: "You won't stop until it stops swelling. So you only stop when you get too tired to keep going."
 deviants_event.0802.b: "Seek pleasure." 
 deviants_event.0802.b.tt: "You can't help it, so you might as well embrace it. Just this once."
 deviants_event.0802.c: "This is enough." 
 deviants_event.0802.c.tt: "Your knob must have learned its lesson. At least you hope it has."

 deviants_event.0810.t: "My Perverted Hole"
 deviants_event.0810.desc: "I slam my palm across my pussy but I don't even feel the pain, only taunting pleasure. So I slam down again, harder. This time I feel it, a moment of pain before it fades away. I give the place a few more strikes but it's clear, this is not enough for my deviant body to repent.\n\nI thrust my fingers into my pussy, spread it open, feeling the wet stain. There is nothing chaste about the place, it's filled with an urge to be penetrated. And I will grant that wish until it has had enough.\n\nI force both of my hands into my depth, stretching me to my limit. But the less mercy I show, the wetter and more swollen I become.\n\nI feel defeated, and I think of giving in. Maybe this is not how to cure myself."
 deviants_event.0810.a: "Keep going. No mercy." 
 deviants_event.0810.a.tt: "You won't stop until the hole stops being horny. So you only stop when you get too tired to keep going."
 deviants_event.0810.b: "Seek pleasure." 
 deviants_event.0810.b.tt: "You can't help it, so you might as well embrace it. Just this once."
 deviants_event.0810.c: "This is enough." 
 deviants_event.0810.c.tt: "Your hole must have learned its lesson. At least you hope it has."

 deviants_event.0900.t: "My Public Shame"
 deviants_event.0900.desc: "I'm being brought to the stage in the gallows along with other deviant women who are being shamed naked before a crowd. I'm accused of looking too much like [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetName] and my perverted acts have tainted her name.\n\nAll of us are getting insulted, and called things while we wait for our turns to be judged by the crowd, the jury of our peers. My face burns from all of the humiliation. And so does that place, my perverted pussy is trying to enjoy even this.\n\nI'm pulled forth on the stage, the crowd goes almost silent while they wait for my confession, to see if I repent and they should be lenient. Or if my crime is so terrible that I should be punished more than the others."
 deviants_event.0900.a: "Endure." 
 deviants_event.0900.a.tt: "You spend your day tied to a pillory for regular public shaming."
 deviants_event.0900.b: "Admit to being a deviant whore." 
 deviants_event.0900.b.tt: "As you admit fucking men more for fun than money, the crowd starts to demand special punishments for you."
 deviants_event.0900.c: "Admit to fucking horses." 
 deviants_event.0900.c.tt: "As you admit to loving horse cock more than any man's, the crowd starts to demand special punishments for you."
 deviants_event.0901.t: "Public Cleansing"

 deviants_event.0901.desc: "The crowd starts chanting, demanding my especially deviant flower to be cleansed. So the guards obey and bring a barrel of water before me. Then they let first of the commoners onto the stage, and he washes his hands in the barrel. Then he walks before me, thrusts his fingers into my pussy, and swirls them around. All the while calling me a sick deviant.\n\nOne by one, the commoners get onto the stage, wash their hands and help to wash the perversion from my pussy. Some only use fingers and others thrust their fist in. Some just slam my mound and tell me that my filthy cunt can't be saved.\n\nThey won't stop coming, not until the sun sets. As my pussy swells and throbs, even some of the women trapped in pillory look at me like I'm the most disgusting deviant of them all."
 deviants_event.0901.a: "Endure." 
 deviants_event.0901.a.tt: "The more your pussy gets washed from inside and the outside, the closer you come to cumming."
 deviants_event.0901.b: "Beg for more." 
 deviants_event.0901.b.tt: "This is not enough for your deviant body. It's not repenting."

 deviants_event.0902.t: "Pole of Shame"
 deviants_event.0902.desc: "The crowd starts chanting, demanding that I will be punished by the Pole of Shame and the guards obey. They lift me up from the chains until I hang from my hands. then they bring out a polished wooden pole that they lock into the stage below me, between my legs.\n\nI'm lowered down while the crowd cheers. the guard makes sure that the pole penetrates me. I'm already so swollen that it won't even stretch me but the hard polished wood slides into me with slight painful friction. Once it reaches my end, the guards see my legs twitch, trying to reach the ground and they stop, not letting my toes reach it.\n\nAs I squirm on the pole, the crowd starts to taunt me, and insult me as they see my transparent juice drip down the pole, showing all just how deranged I am. At that moment, I feel more shame from the pain numbing away than from anything they say.\n\nThe crowd starts throwing things, dirty things at me, staining my skin. But nothing makes me feel as dirty as what is already on the inside, tainting my core."
 deviants_event.0902.a: "Endure." 
 deviants_event.0902.a.tt: "Your pussy throbs against the hard wood, and the shame. It burns."
 deviants_event.0902.b: "Beg for more." 
 deviants_event.0902.b.tt: "This is not enough for your deviant body. It's not repenting. But it's all you are going to get as you spend your day like that."
